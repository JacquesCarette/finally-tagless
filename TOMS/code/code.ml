(* We now define a lot of infrastructure.  We will be quite

   cannot be so easily automated in MetaOCaml -- that would require 
   introspection.  It could be done in camlp4, but that seems too 
   much as well.  This 'base' could be elided, but when we decide
   to make more use of Abstract Interpretation, we'll regret it,
   so do it now. *)
