Corrections to the paper:

The format for citations in text should be consistent but is not
("Nielson & Nielson 1988, 1992" vs "Birkedal and Welinder, 1993").

On pages 7, 21, and 31, "Hindley-Milner" should be typeset using a
hyphen rather than an en-dash.

Page 5, bottom line: "http://www.metaocaml.org" should be set in
Computer Modern Typewriter, like all other URLs in this paper.

are as follow:" -> "Our contributions are as follows."  Please note the
final letter "s" and the final period instead of a colon.

p9: change the line (within eq (2))
   H(fix f.e) = fix(\x -> H(e))   M(fix x.e) = fix (fun x -> M(e))

into
   H(fix f.e) = fix(\f -> H(e))   M(fix f.e) = fix (fun f -> M(e))

That is, change all three occurrences of 'x' in this line into 'f'.

"Template Haskell (Sheard and Peyton Jones 2002) as our"  After all,
a Haskell feature is not a paper but can only be described by a paper.

It's important that the period be outside the pair of quotation marks.

References:
Bawden, Alan (1999). It seems the name of the editor is mis-arranged:
it should be Olivier Danvy rather than Danvy Olivier.

Reference to our APLAS paper:
	-- Ken's name is mis-typed. It should be "Shan, Chung-chieh".
	-- Aplas must be in all caps.

Reference to Fogarty, Seth, Pasalic, Emir, ...
Emir's last name should be Pa{\v s}ali{\'c}

We would also ask for the following two layout changes:

In Fig.2, write the first line
	module type Symantics = sig type ('s,'dv) repr
as two lines
	module type Symantics = sig 
	  type ('s,'dv) repr
Similarly, in Fig. 3, split the first line
	module EX(S: Symantics) = struct open S
into two:
	module EX(S: Symantics) = struct 
          open S
