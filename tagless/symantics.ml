(* The signature, so it can be more easily reused elsewhere.
 * Leave the test in too. *)

(*
  The language is simply-typed lambda-calculus with fixpoint,
  integers [plus basic operations], booleans [ditto] and comparison.

  Lam hoas_fn | App e e | Fix hoas_fn |
  I Int | Add ie1 ie2 | Mul ie1 ie2 
  B Bool |
  IF b e-then e-else
  
  The language is just expressive enough for the Gibonacci and
  power functions.

  The compiler, the interpreter and the source and target languages
  are *all* typed. The interpreter and the compiler use no tags.
  There is no pattern-match failure possible: the evaluators never
  get stuck.
