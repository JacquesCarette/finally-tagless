Making the exploration-exploitation trade-off
in the generalize-specialize approach to mathematical software

   Executive Summary:
   Please provide an executive summary of your proposal. The summary
   should highlight the strategic problem or opportunity you intend to
   address, the main activities of your proposed project, including any
   innovative approaches, and the anticipated concrete outputs and
   outcomes. Please limit your response to 1,300 characters.

The creation and application of abstractions is one of the most
celebrated and widespread modes of mathematical reasoning, yet it is
elusive even in the engineering of software for mathematics.
How can an expression simplifier decide to prove a lemma
that holds for all monoids, and how can an equation solver decide to
optimize its machine code for subproblems of a linear form?  We aim to
build prototype software that makes such decisions and carries them out
under the inherent uncertainty of creative research.  To do so, we will
combine recently developed (a) algorithms in artificial intelligence
for making the exploration-exploitation trade-off; (b) techniques in
symbolic computation for representing and composing code; (c) constructs
in programming languages for generating and prioritizing execution
paths.  The confluence of these interdisciplinary developments makes
the time ripe for advancing this area of foundational and practical
importance.  As internationally recognized experts on these disciplines,
we will organize a series of focused research workshops, 
involving graduate students and invited experts.  As well as producing
software, we will document (through scientific papers) our work, and
produce tutorials for a wide variety of audiences.

   Project Description:
   Please describe the program or project for which you are seeking
   support. What activities are involved in the project? Who will be
   involved (as co-investigators, co-organizers, speakers at a conference,
   judges, etc.)? What core questions or hypotheses do you plan to
   explore, including any possible "Big Questions"? Please limit your
   response to 4,000 characters.

Our big question:  ``How do we automate as much of mathematics as 
possible?''  We propose to explore the question of the appropriate 
software infrastructure needed for a ``mathematical assistant''.  A
tremendous amount of mathematical knowledge already exists in various
forms -- formalized proofs, informal proofs, computational procedures, etc.
Our interest lies in assembling digital mathematical information into
reusable components in such a way that the result is properly scalable
(current systems are discovering the severe limits of their designs).
Frequently these systems do not take advantage of the inherent structures
present in mathematical theories.  In other words, the polymorphism 
which is prevalent in mathematics is not properly leveraged in current
systems.  Furthermore, a lot of current work focuses on algorithms
and decision procedures, which we know are fundamentally limited in their
scope.  We wish to attack the problem head-on: by properly combining
algorithms and semi-decision procedures, we want to build tools for ``hard''
problems.  The simplest of these is surely SAT, well-known to be NP-complete.
It is also well-known that many structured SAT problems are actually 
solvable in polynomial time, at least once the appropriate structure is found
and exploited.  This generalizes: undecidable problems such as expression
simplification, and even termination checking, are frequently quite 
tractable once the proper `structure' is found and exploited.

But to do this, we need to arrange our software in quite different ways.
As our running example, we will use expression simplification, which 
is basically the process of looking for ``smaller'' expressions which are
semantically equivalent.  Our abstract approach would proceed something
like this:  

Start ``simplifying'' by (recursively) applying rewrite rules
which are known simplifiers, but while doing this process ``learn'' the
structural properties of the expression; use this information for 
predicting how long the current process will take.  If this is small, just
proceed, else see if there is sufficient known structure to exploit a 
specialized algorithm, otherwise continue exploring the expression, both
for applicable simplifications and also using structure-revealing 
transformations (which are not necessarily simplifications).  It would
be unwise to write our software such that all transformations and 
structure-revealing transformations were aware of the larger search, 
back-tracking, learning, weaving of different phases, etc happening in the
driver algorithm -- but this is not how things are currently done!  We want
to use modern knowledge of programming languages to help use organize and
modularize these various aspects of complex mathematical code.
