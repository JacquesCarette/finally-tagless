Making the exploration-exploitation trade-off
in the generalize-specialize approach to mathematical software

   Executive Summary:
   Please provide an executive summary of your proposal. The summary
   should highlight the strategic problem or opportunity you intend to
   address, the main activities of your proposed project, including any
   innovative approaches, and the anticipated concrete outputs and
   outcomes. Please limit your response to 1,300 characters.

The creation and application of abstractions is one of the most
celebrated and widespread modes of mathematical reasoning, yet it is
elusive even in the engineering of software for mathematics.
How can an expression simplifier decide to prove a lemma
that holds for all monoids, and how can an equation solver decide to
optimize its machine code for subproblems of a linear form?  We aim to
build prototype software that makes such decisions and carries them out
under the inherent uncertainty of creative research.  To do so, we will
combine recently developed (a) algorithms in artificial intelligence
for making the exploration-exploitation trade-off; (b) techniques in
symbolic computation for representing and composing code; (c) constructs
in programming languages for generating and prioritizing execution
paths.  The confluence of these interdisciplinary developments makes
the time ripe for advancing this area of foundational and practical
importance.  As internationally recognized experts on these disciplines,
we will organize a series of focused research workshops, 
involving graduate students and invited experts.  As well as producing
software, we will document our work through scientific papers and
produce tutorials for a wide variety of audiences.

   Project Description:
   Please describe the program or project for which you are seeking
   support. What activities are involved in the project? Who will be
   involved (as co-investigators, co-organizers, speakers at a conference,
   judges, etc.)? What core questions or hypotheses do you plan to
   explore, including any possible "Big Questions"? Please limit your
   response to 4,000 characters.

Our big questions are, what do mathematicians do, and how can
computers best help?  A common informal answer to the first question
is that mathematicians alternate between proving general theorems and
calculating special cases.  Analogously, mathematics software today can
be categorized as either provers or calculators.  Just as it is ill
understood how mathematicians mediate between the two crucial activities
of proof and calculation, the two kinds of mathematics software --
though both valuable -- are engineered with incompatible organizations
today.  We propose to build the software infrastructure needed for a
mathematical assistant to intertwine these activities and thus model how
a mathematician too might do so.

A tremendous amount of mathematical knowledge already exists in
various forms -- formalized proofs, informal arguments, computational
procedures, etc.  Mathematicians are much better than mathematics
software today at using all this knowledge, for at least two reasons.
First, digital mathematical knowledge has yet to be assembled into
a scalable collection of reusable components.  Current systems are
discovering the severe limits of their designs, which do not take
advantage of how *general* mathematical theories are.  Second, the
current focus on complete algorithms and decision procedures does
not explain how to recognize the *special* structure present in most
problems that lets them be solved efficiently.  For example, although
SAT is an NP-complete problem, and although expression simplification
and termination checking are undecidable in general, instances of these
problems encountered in practice are frequently quite tractable -- even
in polynomial time -- once the proper structure is found and exploited.
We wish to attack these `hard' problems head-on by orchestrating
semi-decision procedures, with the help of algorithms from artificial
intelligence (especially from reinforcement learning) for balancing
exploring generalizations against exploiting specializations.

But to do this, we need to arrange our software in quite different ways.
As our running example, we will use expression simplification, which 
is basically the process of looking for ``smaller'' expressions which are
semantically equivalent.  Our abstract approach would proceed something
like this:  

Start ``simplifying'' by (recursively) applying rewrite rules
which are known simplifiers, but while doing this process ``learn'' the
structural properties of the expression; use this information for 
predicting how long the current process will take.  If this is small, just
proceed, else see if there is sufficient known structure to exploit a 
specialized algorithm, otherwise continue exploring the expression, both
for applicable simplifications and also using structure-revealing 
transformations (which are not necessarily simplifications).  It would
be unwise to write our software such that all transformations and 
structure-revealing transformations were aware of the larger search, 
back-tracking, learning, weaving of different phases, etc happening in the
driver algorithm -- but this is not how things are currently done!  We want
to use modern knowledge of programming languages to help use organize and
modularize these various aspects of complex mathematical code.
