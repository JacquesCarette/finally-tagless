   Project title:
   Please provide us with a descriptive project title. Please limit your
   response to 150 characters.

Making the exploration-exploitation trade-off
to generalize and specialize mathematical software

   Executive Summary:
   Please provide an executive summary of your proposal. The summary
   should highlight the strategic problem or opportunity you intend to
   address, the main activities of your proposed project, including any
   innovative approaches, and the anticipated concrete outputs and
   outcomes. Please limit your response to 1,300 characters.

The creation and application of abstractions is one of the most
celebrated and widespread modes of mathematical reasoning, yet it is
elusive even in the engineering of off-the-shelf computer algebra
systems.  How can an expression simplifier decide to prove a lemma
that holds for all monoids, and how can an equation solver decide to
optimize its machine code for subproblems of a linear form?  We aim to
build prototype software that makes such decisions and carries them out
under the inherent uncertainty of creative research.  To do so, we will
combine recently developed (a) algorithms in artificial intelligence
for making the exploration-exploitation trade-off; (b) techniques in
symbolic computation for representing and composing code; (c) constructs
in programming languages for generating and prioritizing execution
paths.  The confluence of these interdisciplinary developments makes
the time ripe for advancing this area of foundational and practical
importance.  As internationally recognized experts on these disciplines,
we will collaborate in a series of focused research workshops, each
also involving graduate students and invited experts.  Along the way of
building software, we will produce scientific papers and interactive
tutorials for a wide variety of audiences.

   Project Description:
   Please describe the program or project for which you are seeking
   support. What activities are involved in the project? Who will be
   involved (as co-investigators, co-organizers, speakers at a conference,
   judges, etc.)? What core questions or hypotheses do you plan to
   explore, including any possible "Big Questions"? Please limit your
   response to 4,000 characters.

   If the description of your project requires the use of special
   characters or formatting that is not compatible with this plain text
   field, use this field to attach this supplemental information. Please
   do not repeat the project description provided above.:

   Strategic Promise:
   Why is the proposed project important relative to the current state of
   knowledge in your field or across fields? Please limit your response to
   1,000 characters.

   Capacity for Success:
   Please explain how you (the applicant, the project team, and/or the
   organization(s) connected to the proposed project) are positioned to
   carry out the proposed activities with distinction and a high standard
   of excellence. Please limit your response to 1,000 characters.

   Expected Outputs:
   Outputs are the specific, quantifiable work products that you will
   create during the project. Examples include but are not limited to:
   academic papers submitted for publication, book manuscripts, conference
   proceedings, training sessions, curricula, prize competitions, films,
   events, and publicity campaigns.
   Please describe the expected outputs of your project. Please limit your
   response to 1,000 characters.

   Expected Outcomes:
   Outcomes are the realistic and measurable differences that you believe
   will result from your project's outputs. Examples include but are not
   limited to: significant new lines of inquiry that might develop if your
   research hypotheses are confirmed, and measurable changes that your
   work might bring about in the actions or attitudes of your target
   audience.
   Please specify the audiences that your project seeks to reach, as well
   as the specific outcomes that you expect will result. Please limit your
   response to 1,000 characters.

   Currency:
   Please select the currency of your funding request. The Foundation
   awards grants in US dollars, euros, and British pounds.

US dollars

   Request Amount:
   Please provide us with the amount of funding you are requesting from
   the Foundation. Please round to the nearest dollar, euro, or pound, and
   do not use symbols or punctuation.

   Total Project Amount:
   Please provide the total amount of funding necessary for the
   implementation and completion of the project. This amount may be equal
   to or greater than the amount of funding you are requesting from the
   Foundation. Please round to the nearest dollar, euro, or pound, and do
   not use symbols or punctuation.

   Additional Funding from Other Sources:
   The Foundation favors projects that have leveraged additional funding
   from other sources. Please provide us with the names of up to five
   additional sources of funding for this project. For each potential
   source, please list the amount of funding you have secured or are
   requesting and the status of your request. We do accept high-quality
   proposals that identify the John Templeton Foundation as the only
   potential funder. Please limit your response to 1,000 characters.

   Proposed Project Start Date:
   Please provide the date you would like to start the project, taking
   into consideration the number of months it will take the Foundation to
   review and decide upon your Full Proposal request. Please refer to the
   Foundation's grantmaking calendar to learn when you will receive a
   decision about your Full Proposal from the Foundation (if invited).

   Proposed Project End Date:
   Please indicate when your proposed project will be completed. The
   Foundation generally funds projects for no more than three years. In
   rare instances the Foundation funds projects for up to five years. The
   Foundation is restricted from funding any project for longer than five
   years.
