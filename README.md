# finally-tagless
Repo of the original work on finally tagless (and a lot of other metaocaml work besides)

Full history included. And quite a bit of work that was never published - there's a few gems still buried in
there for the adventurous software archeologist. Several papers (latex source and metaocaml/Haskell sources included)
are here too. And some unfinished experiments to boot.
