  abstract = {This article describes the context, design, and recent development
of the LAPACK for Clusters (LFC) project. It
has been developed in the framework of Self-Adapting
Numerical Software (SANS) since we believe such an
approach can deliver the convenience and ease of use of
existing sequential environments bundled with the power
and versatility of highly-tuned parallel codes that execute
on clusters. Accomplishing this task is far from trivial as
we argue in the paper by presenting pertinent case studies
and possible usage scenarios.},
