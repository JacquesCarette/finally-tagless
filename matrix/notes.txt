* Questions for Neil Jones

What exactly Neil Jones meant by Jones-optimality. Is it to be
understood in a narrow sense, with the application to the
self-interpreter? Or a wider interpretation is possible, with relation
to tag elimination. The second (perhaps implicit) question is to
solicit Neil Jones' comments about novelty, utility and interest of
our approach. Since you and Ken have raised the issue of
self-interpreter and obviously know about it, perhaps you would like
to explain the issue of self-interpretation and our questions.

* Our contributions

What are our contributions:
1) a much clearer implementation
2) a nicely comparable Haskell/MetaOCaml version
3) a functorial Symantics that deals with interp/comp/pe uniformly
4) clear and easy extensibility to more features

In sharp contrast to Danvy's paper, all the evaluators in our case
cannot produce any pattern-match error! Except for the partial
evaluator, there are NO patterns to match. And this is critical for
tag elimination -- pattern matching means there are no tags. And in
PE, the pattern-match deals with phases rather than with types. Also,
in our case the exhaustiveness of the pattern match is apparent to the
compiler -- that's why there are no tags.

Anyway, I think it is important for our paper to reproduce the code
from Walid's paper, with deBruin indices. We don't actually need HO
syntax, we can fully implement Walid's example as it is.


* the inductive type function 'dv -> 'sv
It's relation to PE and CPS. Currently, our CPS is CBN. Need to
investigate CBV.

See incope1.hs for another way to compute the function -- literally as
a type-level function. Need to thank Martin (it was something that he
mentioned that made me realize how to fix the problem. It still seems
to be a problem with GHC, because Hugs infers a different type. This
is a gray area, it seems)


* Other issues
rank-2 polymorphism...
