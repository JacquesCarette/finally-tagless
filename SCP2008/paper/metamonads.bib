  abstract	= "We show how a set of {\it building blocks\/} can be used to construct programming language interpreters, and present implementations of such building blocks capable of supporting many commonly known features, including
		  simple expressions, three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, call-by-value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment, nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing. The underlying
		  mechanism of our system is {\it monad transformers\/}, a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations, and exceptions. Our work is significant in the
		  following respects. First, we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter based on monad transformers that incudes features missing from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts. Second, we have found
		  new ways to lift monad operations through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated that interactions between features are reflected in liftings
		  and that semantics can be changed by reordering monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise
		  and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation includes a method for constructing extensible unions and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.",

existing sequential environments bundled with the power
and versatility of highly-tuned parallel codes that execute
on clusters. Accomplishing this task is far from trivial as
we argue in the paper by presenting pertinent case studies
and possible usage scenarios.},
